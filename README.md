# MC-BRB: Maximum Clique Solver

MC-BRB is a high-performance implementation of a branch-and-reduce-bound algorithm for finding the maximum clique in undirected graphs. This project provides efficient solutions for the Maximum Clique Problem, which has applications in social network analysis, computational biology, pattern recognition, and various optimization problems.

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites

- C++11 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Make

### Compilation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Run `make` to compile the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Schoksi20/Database
cd MC-BRB
make
```

This will create the executable `MC-BRB` in the current directory.

## Usage

The basic syntax for running the program is:

```bash
./MC-BRB MC-BRB .\datasets\Amazon\
```
Here you can replace the .\datasets\{your dataset}

## Input Format

The program supports two input formats:

### Binary Format

This is the preferred format for large graphs. The directory should contain:
- `b_degree.bin`: Contains vertex count, edge count, and degree of each vertex
- `b_adj.bin`: Contains adjacency lists for all vertices

### Text Format

If binary files are not found, the program will look for a text file:
- `graph.txt`: The first line contains the number of vertices and edges
  Following lines contain the edges (one per line, space-separated vertex IDs)

Example:
```
5 7
0 1
0 2
1 2
1 3
2 3
2 4
3 4
```

## Output

The program outputs:
- Maximum clique size
- Execution time
- The vertices in the maximum clique (if the clique size is â‰¤ 100)

## Performance Notes

- **Large Graphs**: For very large graphs (millions of vertices), the MC-DD or MC-EGO algorithms may be more practical than MC-BRB
- **Dense Graphs**: The algorithm automatically uses specialized data structures for dense graphs
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption scales with the size of the graph and the maximum degree of vertices

## Algorithm Details

- **MC-DD**: Degeneracy-based maximal clique finder. Fast but may not find the optimal solution.
- **MC-EGO**: Explores ego networks of high-degree vertices to find large cliques. Often provides good solutions quickly.
- **MC-BRB**: Exact algorithm that is guaranteed to find a maximum clique. Uses a combination of branch-and-bound with advanced reduction techniques.
- **verify**: Verifies if the clique in `clique.txt` is valid.
